Uniducial is a library to simplify the development of Unity based games or applications for table-based tangible user interfaces. Fiducial markers are used on these tables to track the position and the orientation of an object.

Uniducial nicely integrates into the Unity GUI and provides the following features:
  * automatic connection to [ReactiVision](http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/)
  * position mapping
  * rotation mapping
  * marker management
  * access to other marker attributes such as velocity, acceleration, rotational velocity etc.
